# Prediction_Of_Phishing_Attacks_Using_SVM
Distinguishes phishing websites from legitimate websites and ensures secure transactions to users. 
Utilizing the SVM algorithm, this system enjoys the benefits of both high detection power and low error rates.

We have implemented the following algorithms in code:

1. Random Forest
2. Decision Tree
3. Gradient Boost
4. Support Vector Machine
